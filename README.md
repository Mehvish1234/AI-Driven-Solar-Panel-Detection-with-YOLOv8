#☀️ Solar Panel Detection Using Deep Learning
This project automatically detects solar panels in images using a deep learning model integrated with a web-based interface. The solution combines Ultralytics YOLO, Flask, and OpenCV, providing both visual insights and analytical tools for image processing and detection.

#🚀 Features
📸 Upload an image to detect solar panels

🤖 Uses YOLO (via Ultralytics) for object detection

🖼️ Real-time bounding boxes drawn using OpenCV

📊 Visualization support with Matplotlib

📈 Image data analysis using NumPy and Pandas

🌐 Web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#🧠 Tech Stack

OpenCV – For image preprocessing and drawing detection results

Ultralytics YOLO – For solar panel object detection

Flask – Backend framework to serve the detection model and manage routes

HTML/CSS/JavaScript – To build the frontend UI

NumPy – For numerical operations on image arrays

Pandas – For data handling and analysis

Matplotlib – For visualizing detection stats or outputs
